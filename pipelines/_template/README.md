## Template pipeline

Folder **pipelines/_template** has a working boilerplate for
a basic Stage 1 pipeline. 

Copy it to begin work on a new pipeline. At a minimum, you will
want to read and edit file 'pipeline.yml' and add code into
an action subfolder.

Edit file **pipelines/_template/README.md** (this file) to document your new pipeline.
Suggested sections to include would be an overview of its purpose, actions,
prerequisites, etc.
